class Segregate(pept.base.Reducer):
    '''Segregate the intertwined points from multiple trajectories into
    individual paths.

    Reducer signature:

    ::

              pept.PointData -> Segregate.fit -> pept.PointData
        list[pept.PointData] -> Segregate.fit -> pept.PointData
               numpy.ndarray -> Segregate.fit -> pept.PointData

    The points in `point_data` (a numpy array or `pept.PointData`) are used
    to construct a minimum spanning tree in which every point can only be
    connected to `points_window` points around it - this "window" refers to
    the points in the initial data array, sorted based on the time column;
    therefore, only points within a certain timeframe can be connected. All
    edges (or "connections") in the minimum spanning tree that are larger
    than `trajectory_cut_distance` are removed (or "cut") and the remaining
    connected "clusters" are deemed individual trajectories if they contain
    more than `min_trajectory_size` points.

    The trajectory indices (or labels) are appended to `point_data`. That
    is, for each data point (i.e. row) in `point_data`, a label will be
    appended starting from 0 for the corresponding trajectory; a label of
    -1 represents noise. If `point_data` is a numpy array, a new numpy
    array is returned; if it is a `pept.PointData` instance, a new instance
    is returned.

    This function uses single linkage clustering with a custom metric for
    spatio-temporal data to segregate trajectory points. The single linkage
    clustering was optimised for this use-case: points are only connected
    if they are within a certain `points_window` in the time-sorted input
    array. Sparse matrices are also used for minimising the memory
    footprint.

    Attributes
    ----------
    window : int
        Two points are "reachable" (i.e. they can be connected) if and only
        if they are within `points_window` in the time-sorted input
        `point_data`. As the points from different trajectories are
        intertwined (e.g. for two tracers A and B, the `point_data` array
        might have two entries for A, followed by three entries for B, then
        one entry for A, etc.), this should optimally be the largest number
        of points in the input array between two consecutive points on the
        same trajectory. If `points_window` is too small, all points in the
        dataset will be unreachable. Naturally, a larger `time_window`
        correponds to more pairs needing to be checked (and the function
        will take a longer to complete).

    cut_distance : float
        Once all the closest points are connected (i.e. the minimum
        spanning tree is constructed), separate all trajectories that are
        further apart than `trajectory_cut_distance`.

    min_trajectory_size : float, default 5
        After the trajectories have been cut, declare all trajectories with
        fewer points than `min_trajectory_size` as noise.

    max_time_interval : float, default np.finfo(float).max
        Only connect points if the time difference between their timestamps is
        smaller than `max_time_interval`. *Setting added in pept-0.5.2*.

    PlotlyGrapher : Easy, publication-ready plotting of PEPT-oriented data.

    Examples
    --------
    A typical workflow would involve transforming LoRs into points using some
    tracking algorithm. These points include all tracers moving through the
    system, being intertwined (e.g. for two tracers A and B, the `point_data`
    array might have two entries for A, followed by three entries for B, then
    one entry for A, etc.). They can be segregated based on position alone
    using this function; take for example two tracers that go downwards (below,
    'x' is the position, and in parens is the array index at which that point
    is found).

class Reconnect(pept.base.Reducer):
    '''Best-fit trajectory segment reconstruction based on time, distance and
    arbitrary tracer signatures.

    Reducer signature:

    ::

              pept.PointData -> Segregate.fit -> pept.PointData
        list[pept.PointData] -> Segregate.fit -> pept.PointData
               numpy.ndarray -> Segregate.fit -> pept.PointData

    After a trajectory segregation step (e.g. using ``Segregate``), you may be
    left with multiple smaller trajectory segments. Some trajectories can be
    reconstructed even when losing the tracers for a bit.

    When a tracer is lost for less than `tmax` time and `dmax` distance, its
    trajectory segments are reconnected; if multiple condidates are possible,
    the best fit is used.

    Multiple tracer signatures can be used to improve the reconnection step;
    supply them as data column names and difference thresholds, e.g. an extra
    keyword argument ``v = 1`` will join trajectories whose difference in
    velocity is smaller than 1 m/s.

    The last `num_points` points on a segment are averaged before they are
    connected with the first `num_points` on another segment.

    *New in pept-0.4.2*

    Examples
    --------
    Reconnect segments that are closer than 1 second in time and 0.1 m apart:

    >>> from pept.tracking import *
    >>> trajectories = Reconnect(tmax = 1000, dmax = 100).fit(segments)

    You can use the `cluster_size` (set by the ``Centroids`` filter) as a
    tracer signature; allow segments to be reconnected if the difference in
    their cluster size is < 100:

    >>> trajectories = Reconnect(1000, 100, cluster_size = 100).fit(segments)

    And a velocity `v` difference < 0.1:

    >>> Reconnect(1000, 100, cluster_size = 100, v = 0.1).fit(segments)
