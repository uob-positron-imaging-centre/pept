cpdef distance_matrix_reachable(

    '''Compute the distance matrix from a time-sorted array of points `pts`
    based on a sliding `points_window`.

    ::

        Function signature:
            distance_matrix_reachable(
                double[:, :] pts,   # Array of points, cols = [t, x, y, z, ...]
                int points_window,
                double max_time_interval,
            )

    The distance between the points (pts[i], pts[j]) is stored in the distance
    matrix at indices (i, j), making it upper-triangular.

    The distance matrix is created and returned using SciPy's sparse CSR
    matrix format. This saves a lot in terms of memory usage, especially for
    time-series data such as moving tracers, as not all points can be
    connected. This format is also closer to the mathematical formulation of
    "reachable points" in terms of undirected (incomplete) graphs - namely
    storing edges as a list of pairs of vertices.

    This is a low-level Cython function that does not do any checks on the
    input data - it is meant to be used in other modules / libraries; in
    particular, the `pept.tracking.trajectory_separation` module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pts : (M, N>=4) numpy.ndarray
        The points from multiple trajectories. Each row in `pts` will
        have a timestamp and the 3 spatial coordinates, such that the data
        columns are [time, x_coord, y_coord, z_coord]. Note that `point_data`
        can have more data columns and they will simply be ignored.

    points_window : int
        Two points are "reachable" (i.e. they can be connected) if and only if
        they are within `points_window` in the time-sorted input `pts`. As the
        points from different trajectories are intertwined (e.g. for two
        tracers A and B, the `pts` array might have two entries for A,
        followed by three entries for B, then one entry for A, etc.), this
        should optimally be the largest number of points in the input array
        between two consecutive points on the same trajectory. If
        `pts` is too small, all points in the dataset will be unreachable.
        Naturally, a larger `time_window` correponds to more pairs needing to
        be checked (and the function will take a longer to complete).

    max_time_interval : double
        The maximum time allowed between two consecutive points for them to be
        reachable / connected. If the interval between two points is larger
        than this, their distance is set to DBL_MAX.

    Returns
    -------
    distance_matrix : CSR <NxN sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>
        A SciPy sparse matrix in the CSR format, containing the distances
        between every pair of reachable points in `pts`.

    Notes
    -----
    In order for the `points_window` to act as a sliding window, in effect only
    connecting points which are around the same timeframe, the points should be
    sorted based on the time column (the first row) in `pts`. This should be
    done *prior* to calling this function.
