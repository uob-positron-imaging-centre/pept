'''The `fpi` package implements the Feature Point Identification (FPI)
algorithm for robust voxel-based multiple tracer tracking, using the original
code kindly shared by [1]_.

Summary
-------
A typical workflow for using the `fpi` subpackage would be:

1. Read the LoRs into a `pept.LineData` class instance and set the
   `sample_size` and `overlap` appropriately.
2. Voxellise the `pept.LineData` samples with a `pept.VoxelData` class (this
   can be done on demand, saving memory).
3. Instantiate a `pept.tracking.fpi.FPI` class and transform the voxellised
   LoRs into tracer locations using the `fit` method.

Extended Summary
----------------
[TODO: add more detailed summary of how FPI works].

It was successfully used to track fast-moving radioactive tracers in pipe flows
at the Virginia Commonwealth University. If you use this algorithm in your
work, please cite the original paper [1]_.
