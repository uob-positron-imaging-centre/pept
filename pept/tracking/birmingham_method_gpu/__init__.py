'''The `birmingham_method` package provides an efficient, optionally-parallel
implementation of the well-known Birmingham method for single-tracer tracking.

Summary
-------
A typical workflow for using the `birmingham_method` package would be:

1. Read the LoRs into a `pept.LineData` class instance and set the
   `sample_size` and `overlap` appropriately.
2. Instantiate a `pept.tracking.birmingham_method.BirminghamMethod` class and
   transform the LoRs into tracer locations using the `fit` method.

Extended Summary
----------------
For a given "sample" of LoRs, the Birmingham method minimises the distance
between all of the LoRs, rejecting a fraction of lines that lie furthest away
from the calculated distance. The process is repeated iteratively until a
specified fraction ("fopt") of the original subset of LORs remains.

The Birmingham method has been used extensively for well over 30 years at the
University of Birmingham to track radioactively-labelled tracers in a variety
of industrial and scientific systems [1]_.
